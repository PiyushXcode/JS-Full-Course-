let name = "Piyush";
let number = 2323;
let isDeveloper = true;

// like this Above data types there are differnt types 
// number = 2 ^ 53
// bigint = for large numbers
// string = "assembly of characters/enclosed within Double Quotes"
// boolean = true / false
// null = stand alone value(type = object)
// undefined = kindda place holder for a value which is not defined yet(type = undefined)
// symbol = uniquness



//Object 

console.log(typeof null);//here the output will  be object as the null is decleared as object in JS;
console.log(typeof undefined);//here the output will be undefined as it is the undefined data ;
